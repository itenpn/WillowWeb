# Willow Web
This is a README file, this is written in Markdown, another way we can display text,
just like HTML. Did you know HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Well Markdown
does the same thing, but with less verbosity.  

## Objectives
My site is incomplete. It's just the barebones! Sadly I don't have enough time to complete
my project. Can you help me out?  

Many times we come to a point where completing projects by ourselves isn't worth the effort.
This is why so many projects are open source, if everyone is able to chip in, we can finish
a project in far less time. Not only does it become more efficient, but we also can benefit
as a result of the new project!  

For this task, everyone needs to split up into groups and make this a functional website.
Use pull requests to complete the following for my code:  

- Give more information about the willow tree? What cool stuff can you find online?  
- Redesign the website. The font is the system default. There is no color! CSS anyone?
- Having all this information on a single page is too much. Can we make different pages? Create a navigation bar to link each of the pages. Can it fit the theme of the redesign?  
- At the bottom, users might want to see a wide variety of willow trees? Can you change a picture at the bottom to be a random tree every 30 seconds?

## Tips
If you feel a little stuck, I'll give some useful pointers. For the redesign team, don't be afraid to look up stuff on  
w3schools. They have tons of information available to help you figure out everything related to CSS.  
For the pages team, just like how the `<a>` tag can take you to another website, you can also change the html file using `<a>`.
The navbar is also pretty simple. Just think of how a table might be able to help you.
For the picture team, you'll want to look into intervals in JavaScript. Also, put the pictures in `public`. You can access files
in public using imports. For example, `import ../public/willowtree.jpg as WillowTreePic` will create a variable called WillowTreePic
that is that picture. the `../` just indicates that we want to look at the parent directory.
